          Check internet connection: Ensure that the internet connection is
          stable and strong enough to support the website's functionality. Clear
          browser cache: Clearing the cache can remove any temporary data that
          might be causing conflicts. Disable browser extensions: Some browser
          extensions can interfere with the website's functionality. Temporarily
          disable them and try adding items again. Try a different browser:
          Switching to a different browser can help identify if the problem is
          specific to the current browser being used. Contact customer support:
          If the issue persists, users should reach out to the customer support
          team of the e-commerce website for further assistance.

          Double-check payment details: Ensure that all payment information,
          such as credit card details and billing address, are entered
          correctly. Try a different payment method: If one payment method is
          not working, suggest trying an alternative payment option provided by
          the website. Contact customer support: If the issue persists, users
          should contact the customer support team of the e-commerce website for
          guidance and assistance. Check with the bank or payment provider:
          Sometimes, payment errors can occur due to issues on the bank or
          payment processor's side. Users should contact them to ensure there
          are no restrictions or problems with their account.
